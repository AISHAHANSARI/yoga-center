      <h4> About Us</h4>
      <p>The Yoga Institute, Bandara (West), Mumbai, India was founded in 1950.
      We believed that yoga was not meant exclusively for bearded men living in the mountains, and we wanted to bring it to householders—the men and women who have to work, toil, commute, earn a living, raise children, and fight the battle of life everyday. 
      We wanted to bring it to people living in the town and the city, because We believed that the householder could benefit immensely from this knowledge. </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Hatha yoga is a comprehensive term that includes all kinds of yoga that is based in physical practice. 
        So that includes styles like Ashtanga and Iyengar but not Kriya, Raja, or Karma yoga that are not based on physical yoga practice. 
        Hatha yoga is best if you are just starting out as the pace is far slower than the other styles. 
        The practice involves having to hold a pose Hatha classes for a few breaths and focuses a lot of meditation and correct breathing and postures. 
        You will also learn some essential relaxation techniques.

        <p class="lead">Founded by B.K.S. Iyengar, this form of yoga is great for those who want to work on injuries and joint problems. 
        It focuses on correct alignment of the body and very precise moves. 
        These postures are held while holding your breath and the duration of each pose increases with expertise. 
        The perfect pose is achieved with the help of props like traps, blocks, and blankets.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Kundalini yoga is one of those mysterious yoga practices that is as spiritual as it is physical. 
        This form is physically demanding and mentally challenging and involves a lot of meditation, chanting, mudras and breathing exercises. 
        The whole point if this style is to release the kundalini energy that is coiled in the lower spine. 
        You have to do a lot of fast moving postures with periods of relaxation where you will be taught to pay attention to internal sensations and the flow of creative energy so that you can tap into your kundalini-shakti. 
        This style is for those who are looking for more than a workout.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Popularised by celebrities worldwide, Ashtanga or the “eight limb path” is very physically demanding so you should not do this if you are a beginner or not in great physical shape. 
        It involves doing multiple surynamaskars followed by standing and floor postures. 
        There are six series of postures that have to be repeated in every class. 
        This kind of yoga is also called Power Yoga and in this style you start with the primary series and then graduate to the next level when you have mastered it. 
        It takes years of practice to master this form. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Vinyasa Yoga.
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">This is an offshoot of Ashtanga and also involves a number of athletic yoga postures and each movement is coordinated with one’s breath. 
        This is also a very physically demanding practice. 
        The pace is quick and you will not have to hold any one pose for too long. 
        The key is to flow from one pose to the next so your heart rate gets pumping. 
        Both Ashtanga and Vinyasa are great if your aim is to tone your body. 
        It also works your core and upper body and gives you a cardio workout. 
        This practice does not have a set structure and often depends on the teacher who might include some meditation and chanting.

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Created by yoga guru Bikram Choudhury, the key feature of this practice is to do a set of poses in a room heated to 41 degrees centigrade and 40 percent humidity. 
        In a 90-minute sequence there are 26 basic postures that are done twice and two breathing exercises. 
        The heat makes you sweat excessively thereby getting your body rid of toxins while the postures work every part of your body and bring oxygenated blood to all your internal organs.
